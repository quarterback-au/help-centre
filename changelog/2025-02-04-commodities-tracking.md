## Commodities tracking

For resource-focused companies, commodity prices are central to how investors evaluate performance. You can now track the commodities that matter most to your story directly in the platform.

Select up to three featured commodities from 28 options spanning precious metals, base metals, battery metals, technology metals, and more. Your selections appear in the dashboard stats bar alongside your share price, showing live prices with element symbols and units, updated hourly throughout the trading day.

The order you select commodities sets their priority. Your first selection becomes the primary commodity, displayed most prominently and available as the benchmark for correlation analysis. This helps distinguish whether share price movements are driven by commodity market trends or company-specific news.

Configure your market settings in **Company Settings → Market**.
