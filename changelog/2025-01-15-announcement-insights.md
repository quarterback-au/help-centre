### What's New

When viewing an announcement with linked activities, Quarterback now generates an AI summary that includes:

- **Reception Analysis** - How investors and media reacted
- **Key Themes** - What people are discussing
- **Sentiment Breakdown** - Positive vs negative coverage
- **Coverage Breadth** - Which platforms and publications covered the announcement

### How It Works

The AI analyzes all activities linked to your announcement and synthesizes them into a concise summary. This gives you a quick understanding of market reception without reading every individual post.

### Where to Find It

1. Open any announcement
2. Expand to fullscreen view
3. View the **AI Summary** section

The summary updates as new activities are linked to the announcement.
