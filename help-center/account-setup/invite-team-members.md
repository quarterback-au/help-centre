# How to Invite Team Members

Add colleagues to your Quarterback workspace so they can collaborate on dashboards, reports, and alerts.

## Steps

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Team Members** from the left sidebar
2. Click the **Invite Member** button in the top right
3. Enter the email address of the person you want to invite
4. Select a role for the new member:
   - **Admin** — Full access to all features and settings
   - **Member** — Access to dashboards, reports, and alerts, but cannot manage billing or team settings

The invited person will receive an email with a link to join your workspace.
