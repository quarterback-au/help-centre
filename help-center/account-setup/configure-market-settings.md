# How to Configure Market Settings

Set up your market preferences so Quarterback can track the right benchmarks, sectors, and indices for your company.

## Steps

1. Go to **Settings** > **Market Settings**
2. Select your **primary exchange** (e.g. ASX)
3. Choose your **sector** and **industry** classifications
4. Add any **commodity benchmarks** relevant to your business (e.g. Gold, Iron Ore, Oil)
5. Add **peer companies** you want to benchmark against
6. Click **Save Changes**

## Why This Matters

Market settings determine:
- Which indices and commodities appear in your correlation analysis
- Which peer companies are included in benchmarking reports
- The baseline for calculating abnormal returns

:::note
Changes to market settings may require up to 24 hours to fully propagate across all analytics.
