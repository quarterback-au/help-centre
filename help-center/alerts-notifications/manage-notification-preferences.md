# How to Manage Notification Preferences

Control which alerts you receive and choose your preferred delivery channels.

## Steps

1. Go to **Settings** > **Notifications**
2. For each alert type, toggle the delivery channels:
   - **Email notifications** — On/Off
   - **In-app notifications** — On/Off
3. Set your **quiet hours** if you want to suppress notifications during certain times
4. Click **Save Preferences**

## Notification Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Sentiment alerts | When sentiment crosses your defined thresholds |
| Price alerts | When share price moves beyond your set range |
| Announcement alerts | When new ASX announcements are published |
| Media alerts | When your company appears in news articles |
| Weekly digest | A summary of all activity from the past week |

## Tips
