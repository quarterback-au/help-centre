# How to Create an Alert Rule

Set up automated alerts so you're notified when something important happens — like a sentiment shift, a price movement, or a new announcement.

## Steps

1. Navigate to **Alerts** from the main sidebar
2. Click **Create Alert**
3. Choose what to monitor:
   - **Sentiment Change** — Triggered when sentiment crosses a threshold
   - **Price Movement** — Triggered by significant share price changes
   - **New Announcement** — Triggered when a new ASX announcement is published
   - **Media Mention** — Triggered when your company appears in news articles
4. Set the **conditions** (e.g. sentiment drops below -0.3, price changes by more than 5%)
5. Choose how to be notified:
   - **Email** — Sent to your registered email
   - **In-app** — Appears in the notifications panel
6. Click **Save Alert**

## Tips

- You can create multiple alerts for different thresholds
- Alerts can be paused and resumed without deleting them
- Review alert history from the **Alerts** > **History** tab

:::warning
Setting very sensitive thresholds (e.g. any sentiment change) may result in frequent notifications. Start with moderate thresholds and adjust.
