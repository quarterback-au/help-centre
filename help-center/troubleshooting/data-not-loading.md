# Data Not Loading

If your dashboards or reports are showing missing data, stale numbers, or loading spinners that won't resolve, try these steps.

## Quick Fixes

1. **Refresh the page** — A simple browser refresh resolves most temporary loading issues
2. **Clear browser cache** — Stale cached data can sometimes interfere. Try a hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
3. **Check your internet connection** — Quarterback requires a stable connection to load real-time data
4. **Try a different browser** — This helps isolate browser-specific issues

## Common Causes

| Symptom | Likely Cause |
|---------|-------------|
| Dashboard shows no data | Market settings may not be configured |
| Sentiment scores missing | Data is still being processed for new accounts |
| Peer benchmarks empty | Peer companies may not be added yet |
| Historical data gaps | Data coverage begins from your account creation date |

## Still Not Working?

If the issue persists after trying the above steps:

1. Check the [Quarterback status page](https://status.qback.au) for any ongoing incidents
2. Contact support by clicking the **Support** button in the sidebar
