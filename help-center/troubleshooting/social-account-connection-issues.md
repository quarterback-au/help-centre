# Social Account Connection Issues

If you're having trouble connecting social accounts or data isn't syncing, follow these steps.

## Connection Failures

If the connection process fails or times out:

1. **Check the platform's status** — Ensure the social platform itself isn't experiencing an outage
2. **Re-authorise** — Go to **Settings** > **Social Accounts**, disconnect the account, and reconnect
3. **Check permissions** — Ensure you have admin access to the social account you're connecting
4. **Disable ad blockers** — Some browser extensions can block OAuth popups

## Data Not Syncing

If the account appears connected but data isn't appearing:

1. **Wait for initial sync** — First-time connections may take up to 1 hour to populate
2. **Check connection status** — A yellow indicator means the connection needs re-authorisation
3. **Verify account activity** — Only accounts with recent activity will show data

## Tips

- Connections are refreshed automatically every few hours
- If a connection token expires, you'll see a notification in the sidebar
- Historical social data is limited to the past 90 days for new connections
