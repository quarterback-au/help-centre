## Share via Link

1. Open the report
2. Click **Share**
3. Toggle **Enable sharing link**
4. Copy the generated link

Shared links are read-only and do not require a Quarterback login.

## Schedule Automatic Reports

2. Click **New Schedule**
3. Choose the report template, date range, and frequency (weekly or monthly)

Recipients will receive the report in their inbox on the scheduled date.

## Tips
