# How to Read Sentiment Analysis

Quarterback uses AI to analyse the sentiment of news articles, social posts, and market commentary about your company. Here's how to interpret the results.

## Sentiment Scores

Sentiment is measured on a scale:

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **Very Positive** (0.6 to 1.0) | Strong positive language, optimistic outlook |
| **Positive** (0.2 to 0.6) | Generally favourable tone |
| **Neutral** (-0.2 to 0.2) | Factual, balanced, or mixed |
| **Negative** (-0.6 to -0.2) | Unfavourable tone, concerns raised |
| **Very Negative** (-1.0 to -0.6) | Strong negative language, pessimistic outlook |

## Where to Find Sentiment Data

- **Dashboard** — Overall sentiment gauge and trend line
- **Activities** — Per-item sentiment tags on each mention
- **Reports** — Aggregated sentiment section with breakdowns
- **Insights** — AI-generated sentiment summaries

## Reading Trends

Look for:
- **Sudden shifts** — May indicate a significant event (announcement, news, etc.)
- **Gradual changes** — Could reflect evolving market perception
- **Divergence** — When sentiment differs between media and social channels
