# Investor Relations

Investor relations (IR) is the strategic management of communication between a company and its investors. Quarterback helps you monitor and optimize this relationship.

## Why IR Intelligence Matters

Understanding how investors perceive your company helps you:

- **Anticipate market reactions** to announcements
- **Identify key influencers** discussing your stock
- **Track sentiment shifts** before they impact price
- **Measure communication effectiveness** after releases

## The IR Ecosystem

### Stakeholders

- **Institutional investors** - Fund managers, analysts
- **Retail investors** - Individual shareholders
- **Media** - Financial journalists and publications
- **Analysts** - Sell-side and buy-side research

### Communication Channels

- **ASX announcements** - Official disclosures
- **Investor presentations** - Conference calls, AGMs
- **Media coverage** - Press releases, interviews
- **Social media** - Direct investor engagement

## How Quarterback Helps

|-----------|---------------------|
