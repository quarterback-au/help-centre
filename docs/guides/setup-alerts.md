## Overview

Alerts notify you when something important happens:
- Significant sentiment shifts
- High-reach mentions
- New media coverage
- Unusual trading activity

## Step 1: Access Alert Settings

1. Go to your Dashboard
2. Click **Alerts** in the navigation
3. Select **Create New Alert**

## Step 2: Choose Alert Type

### Sentiment Alerts
Trigger when overall sentiment changes significantly.

- **Threshold**: Set the sentiment change that triggers an alert
- **Timeframe**: How quickly the change must occur
- **Example**: Alert when sentiment drops 0.3 points in 24 hours

### Activity Alerts
Trigger for high-impact mentions.

- **Reach threshold**: Minimum audience size
- **Engagement threshold**: Likes, shares, comments
- **Source filter**: Specific platforms or publishers

### Announcement Alerts
Get notified about market reactions.

- **AR threshold**: Abnormal return significance
- **Z-Score threshold**: Statistical significance level

## Step 3: Configure Delivery

Choose how you want to be notified:

| Channel | Best For |

| Email | Detailed summaries |
| Slack | Team notifications |
| SMS | Urgent alerts only |

## Step 4: Set Frequency

## Best Practices

1. **Start conservative** - Begin with high thresholds, then adjust
