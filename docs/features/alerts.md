# Alerts

Alerts notify you when important events occur—price movements, activity spikes, sentiment shifts, or new media coverage.

## Alert Types

### Price Movement

Triggers when your share price moves beyond a specified percentage from open. Set threshold (e.g., 5%) to receive alerts on significant price movements.

### Activity Level

Triggers when activity volume changes by a specified percentage compared to the previous period. Choose comparison interval: day, week, or month.

### Sentiment

Triggers on activities matching a sentiment threshold. Set to alert on highly positive (> 0.5) or highly negative (< -0.5) content.

### Broad Search

Triggers when activities match AI-generated search embeddings for specific keywords. Choose relevance level: most relevant, highly relevant, or moderately relevant.

### Media Activity

Triggers whenever new media articles are published about your company. No threshold needed—you'll be notified of all media coverage.

### Daily Recap

Comprehensive daily summary sent at 6pm AWST including:

- Sentiment metrics and trends
- Activity counts vs yesterday
- Share price movement
- Top positive and negative activities
- Media highlights

### Weekly Recap

Comprehensive weekly summary sent on your chosen day at 6pm AWST. Same content as daily recap but comparing week-over-week with expanded activity highlights.
