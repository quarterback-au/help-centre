# Media Monitoring

Track news coverage and media articles from publishers worldwide.

## Publisher View

The media page aggregates articles by publisher, showing:

- Publisher name and logo
- Global news rank (from Newscatcher)
- Article count for the period
- Paid vs organic breakdown

## Publisher Rankings

Newscatcher integration provides global publisher rankings. Lower rank numbers indicate more influential publications. Rankings help prioritize which coverage matters most.

## Paid vs Organic Tracking

Articles are tagged as paid or organic:

- **Paid** – Sponsored placements, advertorials

The breakdown appears in the grid and detail panels, helping distinguish earned media from paid distribution.
