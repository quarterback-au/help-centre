# Dashboard

The dashboard is your central hub for monitoring share price activity, audience engagement, and market sentiment at a glance.

## What You'll See

### Stats Bar

Six key metrics appear at the top of the dashboard:

- **Activities** – Total activity count for the selected period
- **Media** – News articles and media coverage
- **People** – Unique authors discussing your company
- **Twitter/LinkedIn/YouTube/Facebook/Mailchimp** – Follower counts with period-over-period change

Each metric shows percentage change compared to the previous equivalent period, with green indicating growth and red indicating decline.

### Share Price vs Activities Chart

The main visualization overlays your share price movement with activity volume. Use this to identify correlations between communications activity and price movements.

**Controls:**
- **Group by** – Switch between Source, Format, or Sentiment groupings
- **Time range** – 1D, 1W, 1M, 3M, or custom date range
- **Overlays** – Toggle Volume, Sentiment, or Followers on the chart

Click any activity cluster to navigate directly to those activities.

### Stock vs Index Performance

Three metrics displayed together:

- Your share price performance (cumulative % return)
- Benchmark index performance (ASX 200 by default, or your configured benchmark)
- Abnormal returns (difference between actual and expected returns)

This helps identify whether price movements are company-specific or driven by broader market trends.

### Sentiment Distribution

Horizontal bars showing sentiment breakdown by source (HotCopper, LinkedIn, Twitter, Reddit). Quickly see which platforms skew positive or negative.

### Activity Breakdown

Two pie charts showing activities by format and by source, helping you understand the composition of your communications landscape.

### AI Summary

The sidebar displays an AI-generated summary of key trends and patterns from the selected period. The summary highlights notable activity patterns, sentiment shifts, and potential areas of interest.

## Date Range

The date picker at the top right controls all dashboard data. Select from presets (7 days, 30 days, current quarter, last quarter) or set a custom range. Your preference persists across sessions.
