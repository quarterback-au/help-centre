# People

Track authors and contributors discussing your company across all monitored platforms.

## People Grid

The people page shows all authors with aggregated statistics:

- Source platform
- Author name with badges
- Average sentiment across their posts
- Activity count
- Last active date
- Stock held status (HotCopper disclosure)
- Average price change on their activity days

## Author Badges

### Frequent Author (Fire icon)

Authors who post significantly more than average. Calculated as mean + 1.5 standard deviations of post count, minimum 2 posts.

### High Reach (Megaphone icon)

Authors in the top 10% by follower count. These voices have outsized potential impact.

### Flagged (Flag icon)

Authors you've manually flagged for attention.

## Flagging & Archiving

Flag prominent people to track them separately. Archive authors to hide them from the main view while retaining data.

Both actions are organization-scoped—your flags and archives don't affect other users.

## Author Details

Click an author to see:

- Profile information and follower count
- All activities from this author
- Sentiment distribution across their posts
- Notes (organization-specific)
- Edit form for updating author information

## Price Impact

The "Average ▲" column shows the average share price change on days when the author posted. This helps identify authors whose activity correlates with price movements—whether causal or coincidental.
