# Market Settings

Configure benchmark indices and commodity tracking.

## Benchmark Index

Select the index to compare your performance against. Choose based on your sector:

- **Broad market** (ASX 200, All Ordinaries) – Good default for most companies
- **Sector-specific** (Materials, Energy, Financials, etc.) – Better comparison for sector-focused analysis
- **Thematic** (Gold Mining, Resources) – For specialized resource companies

Your benchmark appears in the Stock vs Index chart and factors into abnormal return calculations.

## Commodities

Enable commodity tracking for resource-focused companies:

1. Toggle "Commodities" on
2. Select up to 3 featured commodities
3. Order determines priority (first = primary)

Featured commodities appear in the dashboard stats bar with live prices.

Choose commodities based on what your investors care about most. A gold miner would select Gold as priority 1. A battery materials producer might choose Lithium or Cobalt.
