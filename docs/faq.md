## Market Analysis

### What is Abnormal Return (AR)?

Abnormal Return is the difference between a stock's actual return and its expected return based on market movements. A positive AR means the stock outperformed expectations.

### What is CAR?

Cumulative Abnormal Return (CAR) is the sum of abnormal returns over a period. It's commonly used to measure the total market impact of an announcement.

### How do you calculate expected returns?

We use the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM):
```
Expected Return = α + β × Benchmark Return
```

Where α (alpha) and β (beta) are calculated from historical data.

### Can I change my benchmark index?

Yes, go to **Company Settings** → **Market** to select your preferred benchmark (AXJO, XSO, etc.) or enable commodity benchmarking.

## Troubleshooting

### Why am I not seeing any activities?

Common reasons:
1. **New account** - Allow 24-48 hours for initial data population
2. **Search queries** - Check your social account configuration
3. **Date range** - Ensure you've selected the correct date range
4. **Platform issues** - Some platforms may have temporary delays

### Why is my sentiment score different than expected?

Sentiment analysis considers:
- Overall tone of the content
- Financial context
- Sarcasm and nuance (where detectable)

If you believe sentiment is miscategorized, you can provide feedback through the activity detail panel.

### My announcement CAR looks wrong

Ensure:
- Your benchmark index is appropriate
- There's sufficient historical data
- The announcement date is correct
- No data gaps exist in the period
